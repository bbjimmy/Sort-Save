sort-save screensaver


Just like the Borg, bringing order to chaos.

SortSave is a re-creation of an old basic program that I used for a screensaver on my old Tandy 1000 computer. The original was programmed in Basic and compiled to run on MS Dos. This version has one mode that re-creates the colors that were used in the original, 16 colors.
